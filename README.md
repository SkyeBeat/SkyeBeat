## I'm Skye! 
### THE Space Fox

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in astrophysics at University of British Columbia. Previous research focuses on black holes and accretion physics, current research focuses on how badly we're gonna get it if we don't do something about the private space industry. 
Outside of that I'm primarily a musician, I write synth-y progressive metal and love sound design. I do a bit of 3D modeling and messing with shaders - because I'm also an aspiring VJ! I love sensory assault :3c

Familiar with:
- Python
- Fortran (somehow)
- C++
- Processing
- Some GLSL
