Whaddup! I'm Skye! 

Currently an undergraduate student at the University of Manitoba, part of the eXtreme Astrophysics Group. My research primarily focuses on black holes and X-ray binaries, but I'm also interested in cosmology and the galactic side of things.
Outside of school I thoroughly enjoy tinkering with electronics, synth patches, and shaders.

Familiar with:
- Python
- Fortran
- C++ (still getting comfortable)

I also fuck with 3d modelling, mostly Blender.
